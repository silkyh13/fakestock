## General info

The stock trading application was made with react, node and express. For the sign up page, I used mysql to store all the information about the user in a user table. The password is hashed with bcrypt for security purposes. It allows a user to login with a verifiable password and this was done with passport.js. You can make investments on the portfolio page. If you input an invalid ticker symbols or if there isnâ€™t enough fund in your account, the purchase will not go through. The portfolio also has a compiled list of all the stocks users own along with their latest prices to indicate performance. The list of transactions shows the history of the investments the user made.
